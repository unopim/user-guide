# Attribute

An *Attribute* is a specification or characteristic of a product, for example, Color, Size, and Pattern are attributes of a T-Shirt. You can also create many attributes for a single product. Product attributes play a major role in the buying decision of the customer.

Attributes determine the type of input control that is used for product options and provide additional information for product pages.

They are also used as search parameters and criteria for layered navigation, product comparison reports, and promotions. You can create as many **attributes** and **attribute families** as necessary to describe the products in your catalog in UnoPim.

Attributes can have different input types that determine not only how you enter the values for the attribute, but also how shoppers can select attributes in the case of options, or enter values.

Product Attributes are a set of characteristics that define a particular product or a group of goods. This means size, color, flavor, package type, etc. constitute attributes. 

Product attributes are not just about the general description of a product, but they speak about the value of products that make it unique.
